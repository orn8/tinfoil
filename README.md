## FAQ

Q: Why aren't my shops loaded?

> A: This usually occurs when the time of your Switch isn't synced to real time. Please use [switch-time](https://github.com/3096/switch-time) to adjust the time of your Switch. Another situation might be that the shop you are trying to access is down currently.


Q: I can't open Tinfoil.

> A: Make sure that you install the latest [Sigpatches](https://github.com/ITotalJustice/sigpatch-updater) on your switch. If the issue still occurs, try booting with fusee.bin instead of Hekate and reinstall Tinfoil.


Q: Network Error 7 occurs when I try to download [something].

> A: This is usually due to a poor network connection. If you are using a LAN cable, try reinserting it.
